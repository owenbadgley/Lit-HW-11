This week, I had more than just getting over it as a lesson in difficulty. I had a Systems exam, which everybody says is one of
the hardest cs classes in the school. On top of that, the professor and all the TAs said that the test was made to be too hard
but the professor thought it didn't need fixing. If I hadn't had that exam, I would have been able to put much more time towards getting over it. I really wanted to beat it, but I just didn't have the time this week. I made it to the orange part 
and fell, and I never opened the game again.
I love difficult games. I think that the definition of games as a self imposed obstacle or whatever is the definition I agree with the most, and I think that getting over it would fall into that category for me. My favorite series of games is Dark Souls,
my favorite developer is From Software, I beat every bonus in Celeste. Hard games give you something to bang your head against,
which I think is a really fun challenge. I love the feeling of overcoming a difficult challenge, and I think that these games]
teach people that they can do anything they set their mind to if they put enough effort and time into.
On the other hand, my game is coming along pretty well. I have created a sort of movement demo, so that I can figure out how I 
want the characters to move. It has two playable characters, which is a pretty good sign. This week I spent some time workshopping the first tutorial level, which teaches the players what each of their specific characters do and how they can be
used to optimally complete the level. I think it would be really fun to make it an extremely challenging platformer, but I don't know if I have the level design ability to make that work. I will give it a shot though.
